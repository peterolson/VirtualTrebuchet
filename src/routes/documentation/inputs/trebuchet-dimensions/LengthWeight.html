<h1>Length of Weight</h1>

<p>
	<strong>Length of Weight</strong> is the distance from the end of the arm to the
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass">center of gravity</a> of the weight.

<p>
	<strong>Note:</strong> If <strong>Length of Weight</strong> is set to zero, the simulation uses a
	different set of equations that assume the weight is rigidly attached to the arm. This is how you
	simulate a fixed weight trebuchet.
