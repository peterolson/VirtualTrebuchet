<h1>Inertia of Weight</h1>

<p>
	<strong>Inertia of Weight</strong> is the
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia">moment of inertia</a> of the
	counterweight around its
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass">center of gravity</a>.

<p>
	The moment of inertia can be found by breaking the weight up into simple shapes, finding the
	moment of inertia for each one, and then combining them together using the
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_axis_theorem">parallel axis theorem</a>. A list of
	formulas for the moment of inertia of different shapes can be found
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_moments_of_inertia">here</a>. The
	<a href="/documentation/ArmExampleCalculations">Arm Example Calculations</a> show how to do this
	for the arm. A similar procedure can be used for the weight.

<p>
	Alternatly, using a 3D CAD software package is probably the easiest way to find the inertia of the
	weight.

<p>
	In general, it is better to have a weight with a small inertia. However a larger inertia comes
	with a heavier weight. The easiest way to get around this is by having a weight that is able to
	pivot. If you do this you can set the inertia of the weight to a small number.
