<h1>Uniform Arm</h1>

<p>
	When <strong>Uniform Arm</strong> is selected the program makes the assumption that the arm has a
	uniform cross-section along its whole length. If the arm has a uniform cross-section then its
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass">center of gravity</a> is exactly in the
	center of the arm and the program can automatically calculate the value for
	<a href="/documentation/inputs/arm/PivotToArmCG">Pivot to Arm CG</a>. The value
	<a href="/documentation/inputs/arm/InertiaArm">Inertia of Arm</a> can also be automatically
	calculated if the arm has a constant cross-sections.
</p>

<p>
	While the <strong>Uniform Arm</strong> option is convenient, most real trebuchets usually have a
	tapered arm which tends to have better performance.
