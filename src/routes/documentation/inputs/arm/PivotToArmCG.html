<h1>Pivot to Arm CG</h1>

<p>
	<strong>Pivot to Arm CG</strong> is the distance between the pivot point and the center of gravity
	of the arm.

<p>
	The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass">center of gravity</a> of the arm is the
	average location of the gravitational force acting on the arm. If the arm has a uniform
	cross-section along its length, then its center of gravity will be located exactly at the center
	the arm.
</p>

<p>
	For a non-uniform arm, the center of gravity can be found by breaking the arm up into simple
	shapes, finding the center of mass of each one, and taking the mass-weighted average of the
	different parts. See the
	<a href="/documentation/ArmExampleCalculations">Arm Example Calculations</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Alternately, the center of gravity can be found by hanging the arm horizontally from a string, and
	moving the string along the arm until it balances. It will balance when the string is at the
	center of gravity.
</p>

<p>
	For the best performance, the center of gravity of the arm should be as close to the end of the
	arm that the weight is attached to as possible.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Note:</strong> When Auto Calculate is checked, the arm is assumed to have a uniform
	cross-section and the <strong>Pivot to Arm CG</strong> will be calculated automatically.
