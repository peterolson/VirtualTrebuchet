<p>This is a list of the errors messages that may be encountered.</p>

<p><strong>The simulation timed out in Stage 1.</strong></p>

<p>
	<em
		>If the trebuchet does not transition out of stage 1 in 10 seconds, the simulation will end
		without going on to stage 2.</em

<p><strong>The simulation timed out in Stage 2.</strong></p>

<p>
	<em

		without going on to stage 3.</em

</p>

<p><strong>The simulation timed out in Stage 3.</strong></p>

<p><em>If the projectile does not land within 3 minutes, the simulation will end.</em></p>

<p><strong>The trebuchet arm went through the ground.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The counterweight went through the ground.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The sling was not in tension for the whole launch.</strong></p>

<p>
	<em
		>In the simulation, the sling is modeled as a rigid component that has a constant length even if
		it is in compression. In reality the sling only works in tension. This error message tells you
		that the sling was in compression for some period of time, so the results probably do not
		reflect reality. The sling also turns red while it is in compression.</em

<p>
	<strong
		>The integration step size went to the minimum allowed value, so the simulation results may be
		questionable.</strong
	>
</p>

<p>
	<em
		>The simulation uses numerical integration to solve the trebuchet equations. Normally the
		simulation adjusts the step size used in the numerical integration to get accurate results, but
		there is a minimum step size. This error message says the step size would need to go below that
		minimum to get good results. For more information see the
		<a href="/documentation/explanation/ExampleProblem">Example Problem</a>, and
		<a href="/documentation/explanation/RungeKutta">Runge-Kutta</a> section.</em

<p>
	<strong
		>The check function went to XX.XXX, which is larger than expected, so the simulation results may
		be questionable.</strong
	>
</p>

<p>
	<em
		>There is a check function that is in the simulation to make sure the trebuchet is behaving
		properly. If the trebuchet is behaving well, the check function stays very close to zero. If the
		check function goes above 0.00001, the simulation will show this error message.</em

</p>

<p>
	<strong
		>A negative value was entered for one or more of the length parameters. Expect odd behavior in
		the results.</strong
	>
</p>

<p>
	<em
		>The simulator will give results if the length parameters have negative values, however odd
		behavior has been observed in the transitions between stages in some cases. Not much effort has
		gone into debugging odd behavior that the negative values may produce.</em
