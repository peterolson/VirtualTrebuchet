<h1>Efficiency</h1>

<p>
	The efficiency of a trebuchet is a measure of how well the trebuchet performed compared to an
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_machine">ideal</a> trebuchet. VirtualTrebuchet has two
	types of efficiency, <strong>Energy Efficiency</strong>, and <strong>Range Efficiency</strong>.
</p>

<p>
	In the case of finding <strong>Energy Efficiency</strong>, an ideal trebuchet is one that converts
	all its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy">potential energy</a> before the
	launch onto <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy">kinetic energy</a> and potential
	energy in the projectile at release. The expression for <strong>Energy Efficiency</strong>,
	η<code>energy</code>, is,

	Since the ideal trebuchet gives all its energy to the projectile, the efficiency can be rewritten
	as,

<p>
	A trebuchet with good <strong>Energy Efficiency</strong> does not necessarily shoot very far
	because the equation for <strong>Energy Efficiency</strong> ignores direction the projectile is
	launched. The projectile could be launched straight up so that it lands right back on the
	trebuchet, and the trebuchet may still have a good <strong>Energy Efficiency</strong>. This is why
	there is also <strong>Range Efficiency</strong>. For <strong>Range Efficiency</strong>, the ideal
	trebuchet is one that gives all its initial potential energy to the projectile, and launches it at
	45° from horizontal. 45° is not usually the ideal release angle for a trebuchet, but that is
	because the projectile usually gains some extra velocity by staying in the sling longer. However,
	for a given launch velocity, 45° is the optimal angle to use to get the projectile to shoot the
	farthest possible. The ideal trebuchet ignores air resistance. The expression for
	<strong>Range Efficiency</strong>, η<code>range</code>, is,
